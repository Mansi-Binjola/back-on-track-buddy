## Inspiration

I am a big procastinator. I always tend to work a day before the deadline. So to reduce my procrastination, I had to cut out from social media platforms. But just saying it is not easy. So to help me with this big issue, I created a buddy who will always be my companion to complete my task.

## What it does

Currently, it works as a link blocking extension. More functionality is yet to be added. The extension has the following features:-
- Add link using input row.
- Add the link of a particular tab using contextMenu.
- Validates if the link is not valid or is a duplicate link.
- Allows deleting links that do not need to be blocked.
- Once the extension is tracking( switched on), it blocks the links mentioned in the blocked links section.
- While tracking, if you open a blocked link. It retracts and shows a beautiful website that shows motivation quotes.
- Auto-sync function which saves links data in the extension, which can be accessed after the browser is closed.

## How it works

All the code written for the extension is in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and follows chrome extension API guidelines.

## Installation

An extension is yet to be enhanced to be available for users as there are lots of bugs. 
But for those who want to try it out can follow the simples steps mentioned below.

1. Download the zip file from GitHub and extract `back-to-track-ext` in a folder.
2. Open chrome extension tab using URL `chrome://extensions`
3. Click on for developers mode.
4. Select `load unpacked` and select the extracted folder.
5. That's it, you are all ready to set!

## What's next
Here's the main sketch of what I have decided for now. So the next step for the extension is to have all the functionality mentioned.
